      equipmentDescription: A belaying pin (club), 50 feet of silk rope, a lucky charm
        such as a rabbit foot or a small stone with a hole in the center (or you may
        roll for a random trinket on the Trinkets table in chapter 5), a set of common
        clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp
      featureDescription: <p>No matter where you go, people are afraid of you due
        to your reputation. When you are in a civilized settlement, you can get away
        with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern
        or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report
        your activity to the authorities.</p>

        \ to sink your craft to the bottomless depths. Your first love is the distant\
        \ line of the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand at<span> something\
        \ new.</span></p>\r\n<p>Discuss the nature of the ship you previously sailed\
        \ with your Dungeon Master. Was it a merchant ship, a naval vessel, a ship\
        \ of discovery, or a pirate ship? How famous (or infamous) is it? Is it widely\
        \ traveled? Is it still sailing, or is it missing and presumed lost <span>with\
        \ all hands?</span></p>\r\n<p>What were your duties on board &mdash; boatswain,\
        \ captain, navigator, cook, or some other position? Who were the captain and\
        \ first mate? Did you leave your ship on good terms with your fellows,<span>\
        \ or on the run?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>You spent your youth under the sway\
        \ of a dread pirate, a ruthless cutthroat who taught you how to survive in\
        \ a world of sharks and savages. You&rsquo;ve indulged in larceny on the high\
        \ seas and sent more than one deserving soul to a briny grave. Fear and bloodshed\
        \ are no strangers to you, and you&rsquo;ve garnered a somewhat unsavory reputation\

    description: "<p>You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific\
      \ god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the\
      \ holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices\
      \ in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not\
      \ necessarily a cleric&mdash;performing sacred rites is not the same thing as\
      \ channeling divine power.</p>\r\n<p>Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some\
      \ other quasi-divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your\
      \ religious service. The <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/appendix-b-gods-of-the-multiverse\"\
      \ rel=\"nofollow\">Gods of the Multiverse</a> section contains a sample pantheon,\
      \ from the Forgotten Realms setting. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple,\
      \ raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you\
      \ a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different\
      \ way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established\
      \ temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that\
      \ you now deny.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\"\

      quite so highly as dwarves do. You always have free room and board in any place
      where shield dwarves or gold dwarves dwell, and the individuals in such a settlement

      <p>Use the tables for the guild artisan background below&nbsp;as the basis for

      >&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h5>Factions of the Sword Coast</h5>\r\n<p>The lack of large,\
      \ centralized governments in the North and along the Sword Coast is likely directly\
      \ responsible for the proliferation of secret societies and conspiracies in\
      \ those lands. If your background is as an agent for one of the main factions\
      \ of the North and Sword Coast, here are some poss<span>ibilities.</span></p>\r\
      \n<p><strong><span>The </span><span>Harpers:&nbsp;</span></strong>Founded more\
      \ than a millennium ago, disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers\
      \ remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which acts to thwart evil and\
      \ promote fairness through knowledge, rather than brute force. Harper agents\
      \ are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept at snooping\
      \ and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and\
      \ innkeepers, rangers, and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harper<span>s&rsquo;\
      \ ideals.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>The </span></strong><span><strong>Order\
      \ of the Gauntlet:</strong>&nbsp;</span>One of the newest power groups in Faer&ucirc;n,\
      \ the Order of the Gauntlet has an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its\
      \ methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors\
      \ on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide\
      \ in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently\
      \ seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order&rsquo;s ideals, and the\
      \ clergy of the order&rsquo;s pa<span>tron gods.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>The\
      \ </span></strong><span><strong>Emerald Enclave:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Maintaining\
      \ balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance\
      \ is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are\
      \ masters of survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in\
      \ Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, rangers, barbarian\
      \ tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods <span>of nature.</span></p>\r\
      \n<p><strong><span>The </span></strong><span><strong>Lords&rsquo; Alliance:</strong>&nbsp;</span>On\
      \ one level, the agents of the Lords&rsquo; Alliance are representatives of\
      \ the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction\
      \ with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the\
      \ Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations,\
      \ wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History,\
      \ and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance,\
      \ plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance<span>&rsquo;s ideals.</span></p>\r\
      \n<p><strong><span>The </span></strong><span><strong>Zhentarim:</strong>&nbsp;</span>In\
      \ recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large,\
      \ as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The\
      \ faction draws employees and associates from many walks of life, setting them\
      \ to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren&rsquo;t necessarily\
      \ criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must often work in secret,\
      \ and are frequently proficient in Deception. They seek aid from the wizards,\
      \ mercenaries, merchants and priesthoods allied with the <span>Zhentarim.</span></p>\r\
      \n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\
      <blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>FEATURE: SAFE HAVEN</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As a\
      \ faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives\
      \ who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs\

      <h5>Where Are You From?</h5>\r\n<p>The most important decision in creating a\

      \ here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify\
      \ the use of this b<span>ackground.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Evermeet.</span></strong>\
      \ The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never\
      \ been to Faer&ucirc;n. They often find it a harsher place than they expected\
      \ when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though\
      \ not mandatory) choice for your<span> homeland.</span></p>\r\n<p>Most of those\
      \ who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some\
      \ infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faer&ucirc;n for a purpose\
      \ that benefits elven culture o<span>r society.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Halruaa.</span></strong>\
      \ Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains\
      \ all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faer&ucirc;n\
      \ who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans\
      \ sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can\
      \ w<span>ork magic.</span></p>\r\n<p>Halruaans usually make their journeys into\
      \ Faer&ucirc;n for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance\
      \ against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You\
      \ might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa&rsquo;s many byzantine\
      \ laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods<span> of\
      \ magic.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Kara-Tur.</span></strong> The continent\
      \ of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faer&ucirc;n, is home to people whose customs\
      \ are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur,\
      \ the people of Faer&ucirc;n likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn&rsquo;t\
      \ your true ethnicity, because that&rsquo;s the blanket term they use for everyone\
      \ who shares yo<span>ur origin.</span></p>\r\n<p>The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally\
      \ travel to Faer&ucirc;n as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous\
      \ merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation,\
      \ then decided to stay when the mission<span> was over.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Mulhorand.</span></strong>\
      \ From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these\
      \ lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is alien to someone from the Sword\
      \ Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left\
      \ your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faer&ucirc;n.\
      \ Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a\
      \ corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts\
      \ <span>of Faer&ucirc;n.</span></p>\r\n<p>Those who leave behind Mulhorand&rsquo;s\
      \ sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life\
      \ do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness\
      \ this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among\
      \ the desert communities of <span>your home.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Sossal.</span></strong>\
      \ Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing\
      \ you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white\
      \ hair, and typically dressed<span> in white.</span></p>\r\n<p>Sossal exists\
      \ far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded\
      \ on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great\
      \ Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers\
      \ without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek\
      \ something incredibly <span>important.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Zakhara.</span></strong>\
      \ As the saying goes among those in Faer&ucirc;n who know of the place, &ldquo;To\
      \ get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more.&rdquo; Of course, you followed\
      \ an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though\
      \ it isn&rsquo;t unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faer&ucirc;n\
      \ for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as<span> you have.</span></p>\r\
      \n<p>You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside\
      \ the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are\
      \ on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might\
      \ better appreciate your ow<span>n deities.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>The\
      \ </span><span>Underdark.</span></strong> Though your home is physically closer\
      \ to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more\
      \ unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of\
      \ which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of\
      \ the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of\
      \ the race that occupies the place&mdash;but you might also have grown up there\
      \ after being captured and brought below when you wer<span>e a child.</span></p>\r\
      \n<p>If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface\
      \ as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal\
      \ behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren&rsquo;t a native, your reason\
      \ for leaving &ldquo;home&rdquo; probably has something to do with getting away\
      \ from a bad <span>situation.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20\

      \ masters, or shopkeepers. You don&rsquo;t craft items yourself but earn a living\
      \ by buying and selling the works of others (or the raw materials artisans need\
      \ to practice their craft). Your guild might be a large merchant consortium\
      \ (or family) with interests across the region. Perhaps you transported goods\
      \ from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from\
      \ traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop. In some ways, the\
      \ traveling merchant&rsquo;s life lends itself to adventure far more than the\

      <h5>Other Hermits</h5>\r\n<p>This hermit background assumes a contemplative\
      \ sort of seclusion that allows room for study and prayer. If you want to play\
      \ a rugged wilderness recluse who lives off the land while shunning the company\
      \ of other people, look at the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/backgrounds/outlander\"\
      \ rel=\"nofollow\">outlander</a> background. On the other hand, if you want\
      \ to go in a more religious direction, the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/backgrounds/acolyte\"\
      \ rel=\"nofollow\">acolyte</a> might be what you&rsquo;re looking for. Or you\
      \ could even be a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/backgrounds/charlatan\"\

      \ pious foo<span>ls support you.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20\
      \ marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5>\r\n<p>Some\
      \ hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion, whereas others chafe against\
      \ it and long for company. Whether they embrace solitude or long to escape it,\
      \ the solitary life shapes their attitudes and ideals. A few are driven slightly\
      \ mad by their years apar<span>t from society.</span></p>\r\n<table class=\"\

    shortDescription: "<p>You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a\
      \ noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant\
      \ political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work\
      \ or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited\
      \ scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an\
      \ honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live\
      \ and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p>\r\n\
      <p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how\
      \ much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn&rsquo;t stand on its\
      \ own&mdash;it&rsquo;s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you\
      \ hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to\
      \ determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe\
      \ your family and their influence on you.</p>\r\n<p>Is your family old and established,\
      \ or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield,\
      \ and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the\
      \ other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p>\r\
      \n<p>What&rsquo;s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head\
      \ of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about\
      \ that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no\
      \ one cares what you do, as long as you don&rsquo;t embarrass the family? How\
      \ does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in\
      \ your family&rsquo;s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p>\r\
      \n<p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet\
      \ ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol\
      \ of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?</p>\r\n<p>These details\
      \ help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the\
      \ campaign.</p>\r\n<p>A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most\
      \ societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you wish to be a knight,\
      \ choose the Retainers feature (see the sidebar) instead of the Position of\
      \ Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who\
      \ serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own\
      \ path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to\
      \ care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps\
      \ <span>you put it on).</span></p>\r\n<p>As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals\
      \ of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other\
      \ token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart &mdash;\

      <blockquote>\r\n<p><span><strong>KNIGHTLY ORDERS OF&nbsp;<strong>FAER&Ucirc;N</strong></strong></span></p>\r\
      \n<p><span>Many who rightfully call themselves &ldquo;knight&rdquo; earn that\
      \ title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor&rsquo;s\
      \ Eternal Order or Mystra&rsquo;s Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other knightly\
      \ orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal\
      \ state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are\
      \ secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular\
      \ philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an\
      \ order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the\
      \ Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors,\
      \ most folk of Faer&ucirc;n who hear the word &ldquo;knight&rdquo; think of\
      \ a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly orga<span>nizations.</span>\
      \ <br><strong><span>Knights of the Unicorn.</span> </strong></span><span>The\
      \ Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters\
      \ of patriar families in Baldur&rsquo;s Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn\
      \ goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The\
      \ reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue&rsquo;s\
      \ tenets. Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in\
      \ places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers\
      \ who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter,\
      \ quests should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for\
      \ the sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should be praised for their\
      \ strengths and comforted in their w<span>eaknesses.</span> <br><strong><span>Knights\
      \ of Myth Drannor.</span></strong> Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were\
      \ a famous adventuring band, and Dove Falconhand, one of the famous Seven Sisters,\
      \ was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city,\
      \ just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again\
      \ in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal\
      \ of building alliances and friendship between the civilized races of the world\
      \ and goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once\
      \ again ride the roads of the Dalelands, and they&rsquo;ve begun to spread to\
      \ the lands beyond. Their members, each accepted by Dove herself, are above\
      \ all valiant a<span>nd honest.</span> <br><strong><span>Knights of the Silver\
      \ Chalice.</span></strong> The Knights of the Silver Chalice was formed by edict\
      \ of the demigod Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe&rsquo;s ethos\
      \ is the nobility&rsquo;s right and responsibility to rule, and the demigod\
      \ is incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. By the decree\
      \ of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon\
      \ themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of Tethyr and reestablish order\
      \ in that kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most popular knighthood\
      \ in Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many knighthoods in fealty to <span>the\

      \ the term &ldquo;knight&rdquo; conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors\
      \ of noble blood, most knightly orders in Faer&ucirc;n don&rsquo;t restrict\
      \ their membership to such individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order\
      \ are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so\
      \ most of these orders aren&rsquo;t limited to fighting types, but are open\
      \ to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the orde<span>r&rsquo;s\
      \ cause.</span></p>\r\n<p>The &ldquo;Knightly Orders of Faer&ucirc;n&rdquo;\

      <blockquote>\r\n<p><span><strong>KNIGHTLY ORDERS OF&nbsp;<strong>FAER&Ucirc;N</strong></strong></span></p>\r\
      \n<p><span>Many who rightfully call themselves &ldquo;knight&rdquo; earn that\
      \ title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor&rsquo;s\
      \ Eternal Order or Mystra&rsquo;s Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other knightly\
      \ orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal\
      \ state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are\
      \ secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular\
      \ philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an\
      \ order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the\
      \ Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors,\
      \ most folk of Faer&ucirc;n who hear the word &ldquo;knight&rdquo; think of\
      \ a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly orga<span>nizations.</span>&nbsp;<br><strong><span>Knights\
      \ of the Unicorn.</span>&nbsp;</strong></span><span>The Knights of the Unicorn\
      \ began as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters of patriar families\
      \ in Baldur&rsquo;s Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as\
      \ their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers\
      \ they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue&rsquo;s tenets. Over time the\
      \ small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr.\
      \ The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals:\
      \ life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken on\
      \ a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their\
      \ completion, and everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted\
      \ in their w<span>eaknesses.</span>&nbsp;<br><strong><span>Knights of Myth Drannor.</span></strong>&nbsp;Long\
      \ ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove\
      \ Falconhand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took\
      \ its name to honor the great but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth\
      \ Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided\
      \ to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship\
      \ between the civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat\
      \ evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the Dalelands,\
      \ and they&rsquo;ve begun to spread to the lands beyond. Their members, each\
      \ accepted by Dove herself, are above all valiant a<span>nd honest.</span>&nbsp;<br><strong><span>Knights\
      \ of the Silver Chalice.</span></strong>&nbsp;The Knights of the Silver Chalice\
      \ was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe&rsquo;s\
      \ ethos is the nobility&rsquo;s right and responsibility to rule, and the demigod\
      \ is incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. By the decree\
      \ of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon\
      \ themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of Tethyr and reestablish order\
      \ in that kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most popular knighthood\
      \ in Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many knighthoods in fealty to&nbsp;<span>the\
      \ crown.</span></span></p>\r\n</blockquote>"

      \n<p>Countless mercenary companies operate up and down the Sword Coast and throughout\
      \ the North. Most are small-scale operations that employ a dozen to a hundred\
      \ folk who offer security services, hunt monsters and brigands, or go to war\
      \ in exchange for gold. Some organizations, such as the Zhentarim, Flaming Fist,\
      \ and the nation of Mintarn have hundreds or thousands of members and can provide\
      \ private armies to those with enough funds. A few organizations operating in\
      \ the North are descri<span>bed below.</span> <br><strong><span>The Chill.</span></strong>\
      \ The cold and mysterious Lurkwood serves as the home of numerous groups of\
      \ goblinoids that have banded together into one tribe called the Chill. Unlike\
      \ most of their kind, the Chill refrains from raiding the people of the North\
      \ and maintains relatively good relations so that they can hire themselves out\
      \ as warriors. Few city-states in the North are willing to field an army alongside\
      \ the Chill, but several are happy to quietly pay the Chill to battle the Uthgardt,\
      \ orcs, trolls of the Evermoors, and other threats to civ<span>ilization.</span>\
      \ <br><strong><span>Silent Rain.</span></strong> Consisting solely of elves,\
      \ Silent Rain is a legendary mercenary company operating out of Evereska. Caring\
      \ little for gold or fame, Silent Rain agrees only to jobs that either promote\
      \ elven causes or involve destroying orcs, gnolls, and the like. Prospective\
      \ employers must leave written word (in Elvish) near Evereska, and the Silent\
      \ Rain sends a representative if i<span>nterested.</span> <br><strong><span>The\
      \ Bloodaxes.</span></strong> Founded in Sundabar nearly two centuries ago, the\
      \ Bloodaxes were originally a group of dwarves outcast from their clans for\
      \ crimes against the teachings of Moradin Soulforger. They began hiring out\
      \ as mercenaries to whoever in the North would pay them. Since then the mercenary\
      \ company has broadened its membership to other races, but every member is an\
      \ exile, criminal, or misfit of some sort looking for a fresh start and a new\

      \ well acquainted with risking life and limb for a chance at a share of treasure.\
      \ Now, you look forward to fighting foes and reaping even greater rewards as\
      \ an adventurer. Your experience makes you familiar with the ins and outs of\
      \ mercenary life, and you likely have harrowing stories of events on the battlefield.\
      \ You might have served with a large outfit such as the Zhentarim or the soldiers\
      \ of Mintarn, or a smaller band of sell-swords, maybe even more than one. (See\

      \n<p>Countless mercenary companies operate up and down the Sword Coast and throughout\
      \ the North. Most are small-scale operations that employ a dozen to a hundred\
      \ folk who offer security services, hunt monsters and brigands, or go to war\
      \ in exchange for gold. Some organizations, such as the Zhentarim, Flaming Fist,\
      \ and the nation of Mintarn have hundreds or thousands of members and can provide\
      \ private armies to those with enough funds. A few organizations operating in\
      \ the North are descri<span>bed below.</span>&nbsp;<br><strong><span>The Chill.</span></strong>&nbsp;The\
      \ cold and mysterious Lurkwood serves as the home of numerous groups of goblinoids\
      \ that have banded together into one tribe called the Chill. Unlike most of\
      \ their kind, the Chill refrains from raiding the people of the North and maintains\
      \ relatively good relations so that they can hire themselves out as warriors.\
      \ Few city-states in the North are willing to field an army alongside the Chill,\
      \ but several are happy to quietly pay the Chill to battle the Uthgardt, orcs,\
      \ trolls of the Evermoors, and other threats to civ<span>ilization.</span>&nbsp;<br><strong><span>Silent\
      \ Rain.</span></strong>&nbsp;Consisting solely of elves, Silent Rain is a legendary\
      \ mercenary company operating out of Evereska. Caring little for gold or fame,\
      \ Silent Rain agrees only to jobs that either promote elven causes or involve\
      \ destroying orcs, gnolls, and the like. Prospective employers must leave written\
      \ word (in Elvish) near Evereska, and the Silent Rain sends a representative\
      \ if i<span>nterested.</span>&nbsp;<br><strong><span>The Bloodaxes.</span></strong>&nbsp;Founded\
      \ in Sundabar nearly two centuries ago, the Bloodaxes were originally a group\
      \ of dwarves outcast from their clans for crimes against the teachings of Moradin\
      \ Soulforger. They began hiring out as mercenaries to whoever in the North would\
      \ pay them. Since then the mercenary company has broadened its membership to\
      \ other races, but every member is an exile, criminal, or misfit of some sort\
      \ looking for a fresh start and a new family among the bold&nbsp;<span>Bloodaxes.</span></p>\r\

    shortDescription: "<p>You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a\
      \ noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant\
      \ political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work\
      \ or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited\
      \ scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an\
      \ honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live\
      \ and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p>\r\n\
      <p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how\
      \ much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn&rsquo;t stand on its\
      \ own&mdash;it&rsquo;s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you\
      \ hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to\
      \ determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe\
      \ your family and their influence on you.</p>\r\n<p>Is your family old and established,\
      \ or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield,\
      \ and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the\
      \ other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p>\r\
      \n<p>What&rsquo;s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head\
      \ of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about\
      \ that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no\
      \ one cares what you do, as long as you don&rsquo;t embarrass the family? How\
      \ does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in\
      \ your family&rsquo;s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p>\r\
      \n<p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet\
      \ ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol\
      \ of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?</p>\r\n<p>These details\

      \ for pay. Unlike some people who collect bounties, though, you aren&rsquo;t\
      \ a savage who follows quarry into or through the wilderness. You&rsquo;re involved\
      \ in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, that routinely tests your\
      \ skills and survival instincts. What&rsquo;s more, you aren&rsquo;t alone,\
      \ as a bounty hunter in the wild would be: you routinely interact with both\
      \ the criminal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining contacts in\
      \ both areas to help yo<span>u succeed.</span></p>\r\n<p>You might be a cunning\
      \ thief-catcher, prowling the rooftops to catch one of the myriad burglars of\
      \ the city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of\
      \ the doings of thieves&rsquo; guilds and street gangs. You might be a &ldquo;velvet\
      \ mask&rdquo; bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles\
      \ in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets\
      \ or con artists. The community where you plied your trade might have been one\
      \ of Faer&ucirc;n&rsquo;s great metropolises, such as Waterdeep or Baldur&rsquo;s\
      \ Gate, or a less populous location, perhaps Luskan or Yartar &mdash; any place\
      \ that&rsquo;s large enough to have a steady supply of potential<span> quarries.</span></p>\r\
      \n<p>As a member of an adventuring party, you might find it more difficult to\
      \ pursue a personal agenda that doesn&rsquo;t fit with the group&rsquo;s objectives\
      \ &mdash; but on the other hand, you can take down much more formidable targets\
      \ with the help of your c<span>ompanions.</span></p>"

      sorcerer, warlock, or wizard. You must choose your spells from that class''s

      tag. The process of copying the spell into your ritual book takes 2 hours per

        \ Slots</span></h5>\r\n<p>The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how\
        \ many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher.\
        \ To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s\
        \ level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish<span>\
        \ a long rest.</span></p>\r\n<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell\
        \ <span>shield</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available,\
        \ you can cast <span>shield</span> using<span> either slot.</span></p>\r\n\
        <h5><span>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</span></h5>\r\n<p>You know\
        \ three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose\
        \ from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizar<span>d spell list.</span></p>\r\
        \n<p>The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows\
        \ when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these\
        \ spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must\
        \ be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach\
        \ 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st <span>or 2nd\
        \ level.</span></p>\r\n<p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level\
        \ can come from any sch<span>ool of magic.</span></p>\r\n<p>Whenever you gain\
        \ a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know\
        \ with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell\
        \ must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration\
        \ or evocation spell, unless you&rsquo;re replacing the spell you gained at\
        \ 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any sch<span>ool of magic.</span></p>\r\
        \n<h5><span>Spellcasting Ability</span></h5>\r\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting\
        \ ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study\
        \ and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your\
        \ spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when\
        \ setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making\
        \ an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Spell save DC </span></strong>=\
